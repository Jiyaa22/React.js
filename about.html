      <h2>React.js</h2>
        <h3>
            React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source 
            JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
            It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
            React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
            However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React 
            applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing.

            </h3>

<h4>
    Lifecycle methods use a form of hooking that allows execution of code at set points during a component's lifetime.
shouldComponentUpdate allows the developer to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of a component by 
returning false if a render is not required.
componentDidMount is called once the component has "mounted" (the component has been created in the user interface,
 often by associating it with a DOM node). This is commonly used to trigger data loading from a remote source via an API.
componentWillUnmount is called immediately before the component is torn down or "unmounted". This is commonly used to 
clear resource demanding dependencies to the component that will not simply be removed with the unmounting of the component
 (e.g., removing any setInterval() instances that are related to the component, or an "eventListener" set on the "document"
  because of the presence of the component)
render is the most important lifecycle method and the only required one in any component. It is usually called every 
time the component's state is updated, which should be reflected in the user interface.
